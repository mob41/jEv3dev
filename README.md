This program is intended for ev3dev beginners with the goal of easy-to-use.

In development stage, I just found that I can make this for fun.

Goals:
- Support 2 Java Libraries. ([ev3dev offical Java library](https://github.com/mob41/ev3dev-lang-java), [ev3dev leJOS Java Library](https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/ev3dev-lang-java))
- Easy-to-use, no difficulties for new users
- "Blocks" to "Java programming code"
- Remote deploy
- SSH Auto-setup

Development stage:
- [ ] Image resources and GUI
- [ ] Blocks
- [ ] ...

This program is quite similar to LEGO offical's one, but with more functions. :)
